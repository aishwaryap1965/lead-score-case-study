* Problem Statement :
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets
its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up
a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form
providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.
Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making
calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted
while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around
30%.
Business Goal:
X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that
are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the
leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion
chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion
chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to
be around 80%.

best according to the interest of the leads. A proper plan to chart the needs of
each lead will go a long way to capture the leads as prospects. Focus on converted
leads. Hold question answer sessions with leads to extract the right information
